    <p>The game of hockey, or field hockey as It is sometimes called, originated thousands of years ago and now many people play Field Hockey as a Hobby. It's traditionally played on grass, but may be played on a variety of surfaces including gravel and sand-based or water-based artificial turf. Commonly hockey is currently played on artificial surfaces - especially at the higher levels such as the Olympics. In fundamental terms, hockey is a two-team sport which sees each team using curved sticks to maneuver a small hard ball about the pitch - the ultimate goal being to get the ball to the goal.

    <p> I play for a team called Wodonga Bulldogs and play in U12s. This year I got picked to play in JSC(Junior State Championships) and JCC(Junior Country Championships). My journey into hockey started when my friend asked if I wanted to come to watch her game. From then on I started playing and really liked it.I also played indoor hockey in U15s and got a trophy for 'Best and fairest'.

    <p1>History </p1>

        <p>The roots of hockey are buried deep in antiquity. Historical records show that a crude form of the game was played in Egypt 4,000 years ago and in Ethiopia around 1,000BC, whilst an ancient form of the game was also played in Iran in around 2,000BC.
            Various museums offer evidence that a form of the game was played by the Romans and Greeks as well as by the Aztecs several centuries before Columbus arrived in the New World.
            The modern game of hockey emerged in England in the mid-18th century and is largely attributed to the growth of public schools, such as Eton.
            The first Hockey Association was formed in the UK in 1876 and drew up the first formal set of rules. The original association survived for just six years but, in 1886, it was revived by nine founding member clubs.</p>
